# Indoor Navigation using Augmented Reality

This repository contains a mobile application for indoor navigation using augmented reality (AR). The application utilizes ARCore, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), the A* algorithm, and QR code repositioning to provide accurate and intuitive indoor navigation. The project is developed using three platforms: Unity3D, Android Studio, and Xcode.

## Features
- **Augmented Reality Navigation**: Provides real-time indoor navigation using AR.
- **SLAM Integration**: Ensures accurate positioning and mapping.
- **A-Star** **Algorithm**: Computes the shortest path for efficient navigation.
- **QR Code Repositioning**: Enhances positioning accuracy using QR codes.
- **Cross-Platform**: Developed for Unity3D, Android Studio, and Xcode.

## Technologies Used
- **ARCore**: Google's platform for building AR applications.
- **SLAM**: Technique for mapping and localization.
- **A-Star Algorithm**: Pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm.
- **Unity3D**: A cross-platform game engine for creating 3D, 2D, VR, and AR experiences.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development.
- **Xcode**: Apple's IDE for macOS and iOS development.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into three main folders:

1. **Unity Project Folder**: Contains the Unity3D project files.
2. **Android Studio Project Folder**: Contains the Android project files.
3. **Xcode Project Folder**: Contains the iOS project files.
